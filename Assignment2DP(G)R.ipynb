            "[\"What symptoms of addiction does Orzack's center list?\", 'Caught in the Web A few months ago, it wasn\\'t unusual for 47-year-old Carla Toebe to spend 15 hours per day online. She\\'d wake up early, turn on her laptop and chat on Internet dating sites and instant-messaging programs - leaving her bed for only brief intervals. Her household bills piled up, along with the dishes and dirty laundry, but it took near-constant complaints from her four daughters before she realized she had a problem. \"I was starting to feel like my whole world was falling apart - kind of slipping into a depression,\" said Carla. \"I knew that if I didn\\'t get off the dating sites, I\\'d just keep going,\" detaching herself further from the outside world. Toebe\\'s conclusion: She felt like she was \"addicted\" to the Internet. She\\'s not alone. Concern about excessive Internet use isn\\'t new. As far back as 1995, articles in medical journals and the establishment of a Pennsylvania treatment center for overusers generated interest in the subject. There\\'s still no consensus on how much time online constitutes too much or whether addiction is possible. But as reliance on the Web grows, there are signs that the question is getting more serious attention: Last month, a study published in CNS Spectrums claimed to be the first large-scale look at excessive Internet use. The American Psychiatric Association may consider listing Internet addiction in the next edition of its diagnostic manual. And scores of online discussion boards have popped up on which people discuss negative experiences tied to too much time on the Web. \"There\\'s no question that there\\'re people who\\'re seriously in trouble because they\\'re overdoing their Internet involvement,\" said psychiatrist Ivan Goldberg. Goldberg calls the problem a disorder rather than a true addiction. Jonathan Bishop, a researcher in Wales specializing in online communities, is more skeptical. \"The Internet is an environment,\" he said. \"You can\\'t be addicted to the environment.\" Bishop describes the problem as simply a matter of priorities, which can be solved by encouraging people to prioritize other life goals and plans in place of time spent online. The new CNS Spectrums study was based on results of a nationwide telephone survey of more than 2,500 adults. Like the 2005 survey, this one was conducted by Stanford University researchers.About 6% of respondents reported that \"their relationships suffered because of excessive Internet use.\" About 9% attempted to conceal \"nonessential Internet use,\" and nearly 4% reported feeling \"preoccupied by the Internet when offline.\" About 8% said they used the Internet as a way to escape problems, and almost 14% reported they \"found it hard to stay away from the Internet for several days at a time.\" \"The Internet problem is still in its infancy,\" said Elias Aboujaoude, a Stanford professor. No single online activity is to blame for excessive use, he said. \"They\\'re online in chat rooms, checking e-mail, or writing blogs. not limited to porn or gambling\" websites. Excessive Internet use should be defined not by the number of hours spent online but \"in terms of losses,\" said Maressa Orzack, a Harvard University professor. \"If it\\'s a loss you\\'re not getting to work, and family relationships are breaking down as a result, then it\\'s too much.\" Since the early 1990s, several clinics have been established in the U. S. to treat heavy Internet users. They include the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery and the Center for Internet Behavior. The website for Orzack\\'s center lists the following among the psychological symptoms of computer addiction: * Having a sense of well-being or excitement while at the computer. * Longing for more and more time at the computer. * Neglect of family and friends. * Feeling empty, depressed or irritable when not at the computer. * Lying to employers and family about activities. * Inability to stop the activity. * Problems with school or job. Physical symptoms listed include dry eyes, backaches, skipping meals, poor personal hygiene and sleep disturbances. People who struggle with excessive Internet use maybe depressed or have other mood disorders, Orzack said. When she discusses Internet habits with her patients, they often report that being online offers a \"sense of belonging, and escape, excitement fun,\" she said. \"Some people say relief...because they find themselves so relaxed.\" Some parts of the Internet seem to draw people in more than others. Internet gamers spend countless hours competing in games against people from all over the world. One such game, called World of Warcraft, is cited on many sites by posters complaining of a \"gaming addiction.\" Andrew Heidrich, an education network administrator from Sacramento, plays World of Warcraft for about two to four hours every other night, but that\\'s nothing compared with the 40 to 60 hours a week he spent playing online games when he was in college. He cut back only after a full-scale family intervention , in which s told him he\\'d gained weight. \"There\\'s this whole culture of competition that sucks people in\" with online gaming, said Heidrich, now a father of two. \"People do it at the expense of everything that was a constant in their lives.\" Heidrich now visits websites that discuss gaming addiction regularly \"to remind myself to keep my love for online games in check.\" Toebe also regularly visits a site where posters discuss Internet overuse. In August, when she first realized she had a problem, she posted a message on a Yahoo Internet addiction group with the subject line: \"I have an Internet Addiction.\" \"I\\'m self-employed and need the Internet for my work, but I\\'m failing to accomplish my work,to take care of my home, to give attention to my children,\" she wrote in a message sent to the group.\"I have no money or insurance to get professional help; I can\\'t even pay my mortgage and face losing everything.\" Since then, Toebe said, she has kept her promise to herself to cut back on her Internet use. \"I have a boyfriend now, and I\\'m not interested in online dating,\" she said by phone last week. \"It\\'s a lot better now.\"']\n",

Bush and Bill Clinton appeared together at a question-and-answer forum before the National Automobile Dealers Association in New Orleans, Louisiana. \\n\\nAsked his biggest regret after leaving office, Bush said he now wonders whether he should have tried to get Saddam Hussein to leave office at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. \\n\\nHe told the gathering, \"I\\'ve thought a lot about it, but at the end of Desert Storm, the question was should we have kind of kept going on that road to death and all this slaughter until Saddam Hussein showed up and laid his sword on the table, surrendered. And the common wisdom was he wouldn\\'t do that.\" \\n\\nBut he said a conversation with an FBI agent who interrogated Saddam after he was captured has made him reconsider. \\n\\nBush recalled their talk, \"I said, \\'What if we just say he has to come to surrender, would he have done it?\\' And this guy said, \\'I\\'m absolutely convinced he would have.\\' My experts tell me he wouldn\\'t have.\" \\n\\nBush said, \"We ended it the way we said we would\" as a military success, but noted a cleaner ending \"would have been perfect.\" \\n\\nHe added, \"If we had tried to get Saddam Hussein to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table, I think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him.\" ']\n",

Beijing native Tan Ge, 25, believes he was not accepted after he stated his interests in infrared technology and nanoelectronics on his application. He now studies in Canada after being forced to abandon a full scholarship to Arizona State University. \\n\\nBy its very nature, the on-the-spot process at the U.S. Embassy can feel unbearable to Chinese applicants, who are asked to take their bank statements, property deeds , marriage licenses and HUKOU, a Chinese household ID. \\n\\n\"It made me feel very uncomfortable,\" said Xu Yong, 28, a journalist who needed a business visa last month to cover a conference in New York. \"They made me feel like someone from a Third World country up to no good.\" \\n\\nAfter giving his fingerprints, Xu waited to be called for his interview, sitting in an area that was as quiet as a library. Each passing minute seemed to be as long as a century. \\n\\nAfter an hour, Xu was called with three other people to a window for their interview. Two were rejected before his turn. Then the American officer, speaking fluent Chinese, reached for Xu\\'s paperwork, asked some simple questions and said, \"Congratulations.\" \\n\\n\"I was so nervous. The first thing I did when I got out was to call my mom and tell her I passed,\" Xu said. \"She was the one who warned me it wasn\\'t going to be easy.\"']\n",

Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies.

Solis is a cousin of Enrique Plancarte Solis, a Familia Michoacana leader, Rubido said. \\n\\nBoth suspects report to Servando Gomez Martinez, known as \"La Tuta,\" Rubido said. \\n\\nGodoy Toscano was elected as a member of the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party, known as the PRD. The party said Wednesday it would not protect Godoy Toscano or any member who has broken the law. \\n\\nGodoy Rangel, the Michoacan governor, told a radio station there\\'s nothing he could do to help his fugitive brother. \\n\\n\"I cannot protect anyone, not even my children,\" the government-run news agency Notimex quoted him as saying. \\n\\nHe said Wednesday that he has no intention of resigning, because he has done nothing wrong, Notimex said.

Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. \\n\\nVandenburg was taken into custody at Nashville International Airport as he flew back into the city, police said. He was then taken to the hospital for a state-mandated blood test before being transported to jail. \\n\\nThere\\'s no word yet on Vandenburg\\'s bond. \\n\\nPolice said McKenzie turned himself in at Nashville police headquarters Saturday morning. He also was taken for the mandatory blood test and is being held in jail on $50,000 bond. \\n\\nLate Friday afternoon, police officers arrested Batey at his Nashville home. He is being held on $350,000 bond. \\n\\nThe former Commodore players are charged with raping an unconscious female inside Vandenburg\\'s dorm room on June 23. The alleged rape happened in the Gillette House dormitory, police said. \\n\\nIn a statement issued Friday the university said \"Our first thoughts are for the victim, a Vanderbilt student, and we convey to her and her family our deepest sympathies and sorrow. We will continue to offer her all of our services and support.\" ']\n",

City officials in San Francisco introduced the app to try to reduce traffic jams in the city, but some say it raises safety concerns. \\n\\nIn this city, drivers searching for parking spots lead to 30 percent of all downtown jams, city officials think. Now San Francisco has found a solution--a phone app for spot-seekers that displays information about areas with available spaces. The system, introduced last month, relies on wireless sensors fixed in streets and city garages that can tell within seconds if a spot has opened up. \\n\\nMonique Soltani, a TV reporter, said she and her sister spent 25 minutes on Friday trying to park. \"We were praying to the parking god that we\\'d find a spot,\" she said. \"If we had the app, we would not have to pray to the parking god.\" But the system could come with serious consequences. \\n\\nSome people say that drivers searching for parking could end up focusing on their phones, not the road. \"It could be really distracting ,\" said Daniel Simons, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. \\n\\nCity officials acknowledge the potential problem. They are urging drivers to pull over before they use the city\\'s iPhone app, or to do so before they leave home. Nathaniel Ford, executive director of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said safety could actually improve if drivers quickly found a spot instead of circling and getting frustrated. \\n\\nSan Francisco has put sensors into 7,000 parking spots and 12,250 spots in city garages. If spaces in an area open up, the sensors communicate wirelessly with computers that in turn make the information available to app users within a minute, said Mr. Ford, of the transportation agency. On the app, a map shows which blocks have lots of places (blue) and which are full (red). \\n\\nMore than 12,000 people have downloaded San Francisco\\'s app, which is available now only for the iPhone but which city officials say they hope to bring to all similar devices. \\n\\nWhen it is started up, the city\\'s parking app warns drivers not to use the system while in motion. But safety advocates said that might not be sufficient. After all, they say, texting while driving is illegal in California and in many states, but a number of surveys, including one by the Pew Research Center, show that many Americans do it anyway. \\n\\nElizabeth Stampe, executive director of Walk San Francisco, a pedestrian advocacy group, said she hoped the new parking app would lead to fewer accidents. \\n\\n\"It\\'s an innovative idea,\" she said. \"The safe way for people to use the device is for them to pull over, which they know they should do. The question is whether they will.\" \\n\\nBut Ms. Soltani, the TV reporter, said using the app would probably join the group of activities already performed by drivers. \\n\\n\"We\\'re already looking at Google Maps and Facebook on the phone while we drive,\" she said. \"Aren\\'t we always looking at something on our phone, or changing the radio, or drinking coffee?

The system, introduced last month, relies on wireless sensors fixed in streets and city garages that can tell within seconds if a spot has opened up. \\n\\nMonique Soltani, a TV reporter, said she and her sister spent 25 minutes on Friday trying to park. \"We were praying to the parking god that we\\'d find a spot,\" she said. \"If we had the app, we would not have to pray to the parking god.\" But the system could come with serious consequences. \\n\\nSome people say that drivers searching for parking could end up focusing on their phones, not the road. \"It could be really distracting ,\" said Daniel Simons, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. \\n\\nCity officials acknowledge the potential problem. They are urging drivers to pull over before they use the city\\'s iPhone app, or to do so before they leave home. Nathaniel Ford, executive director of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said safety could actually improve if drivers quickly found a spot instead of circling and getting frustrated. \\n\\nSan Francisco has put sensors into 7,000 parking spots and 12,250 spots in city garages. If spaces in an area open up, the sensors communicate wirelessly with computers that in turn make the information available to app users within a minute, said Mr. Ford, of the transportation agency. On the app, a map shows which blocks have lots of places (blue) and which are full (red). \\n\\nMore than 12,000 people have downloaded San Francisco\\'s app, which is available now only for the iPhone but which city officials say they hope to bring to all similar devices. \\n\\nWhen it is started up, the city\\'s parking app warns drivers not to use the system while in motion. But safety advocates said that might not be sufficient. After all, they say, texting while driving is illegal in California and in many states, but a number of surveys, including one by the Pew Research Center, show that many Americans do it anyway. \\n\\nElizabeth Stampe, executive director of Walk San Francisco, a pedestrian advocacy group, said she hoped the new parking app would lead to fewer accidents. \\n\\n\"It\\'s an innovative idea,\" she said. \"The safe way for people to use the device is for them to pull over, which they know they should do.
