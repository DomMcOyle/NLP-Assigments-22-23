It\\'s the first time we can choose our own representatives,\" said Walid Marrakchi, a civil engineer who waited more than two hours, and who brought along his 3-year-old son Ahmed so he could \"get used to freedom and democracy.\" \\n\\nTunisia\\'s election is the first since a popular uprising in January overthrew long-time dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and triggered a wave of revolutions -- referred to as the Arab Spring -- across the region. \\n\\nMore than 60 political parties and thousands of independent candidates competed for 218 seats in a new Constitutional Assembly, which will be charged with writing a new constitution and laying the framework for a government system. \\n\\nVoters appeared jubilant on Sunday, taking photos of each other outside polling stations, some holding Tunisian flags. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a holiday,\" said housewife Maha Haubi, who had just taken her position at the end of the long line of more than 1,000 voters waiting outside an elementary school in Menzah. \\n\\n\"Before we never even had the right to say \\'yes\\' or \\'no.\\'\" \\n\\nNearby, banker Aid Naghmaichi said she didn\\'t mind the long wait to vote.

            "[\"What symptoms of addiction does Orzack's center list?\", 'Caught in the Web A few months ago, it wasn\\'t unusual for 47-year-old Carla Toebe to spend 15 hours per day online. She\\'d wake up early, turn on her laptop and chat on Internet dating sites and instant-messaging programs - leaving her bed for only brief intervals. Her household bills piled up, along with the dishes and dirty laundry, but it took near-constant complaints from her four daughters before she realized she had a problem. \"I was starting to feel like my whole world was falling apart - kind of slipping into a depression,\" said Carla. \"I knew that if I didn\\'t get off the dating sites, I\\'d just keep going,\" detaching herself further from the outside world. Toebe\\'s conclusion: She felt like she was \"addicted\" to the Internet. She\\'s not alone. Concern about excessive Internet use isn\\'t new. As far back as 1995, articles in medical journals and the establishment of a Pennsylvania treatment center for overusers generated interest in the subject. There\\'s still no consensus on how much time online constitutes too much or whether addiction is possible. But as reliance on the Web grows, there are signs that the question is getting more serious attention: Last month, a study published in CNS Spectrums claimed to be the first large-scale look at excessive Internet use. The American Psychiatric Association may consider listing Internet addiction in the next edition of its diagnostic manual. And scores of online discussion boards have popped up on which people discuss negative experiences tied to too much time on the Web. \"There\\'s no question that there\\'re people who\\'re seriously in trouble because they\\'re overdoing their Internet involvement,\" said psychiatrist Ivan Goldberg. Goldberg calls the problem a disorder rather than a true addiction. Jonathan Bishop, a researcher in Wales specializing in online communities, is more skeptical. \"The Internet is an environment,\" he said. \"You can\\'t be addicted to the environment.\" Bishop describes the problem as simply a matter of priorities, which can be solved by encouraging people to prioritize other life goals and plans in place of time spent online. The new CNS Spectrums study was based on results of a nationwide telephone survey of more than 2,500 adults. Like the 2005 survey, this one was conducted by Stanford University researchers.About 6% of respondents reported that \"their relationships suffered because of excessive Internet use.\" About 9% attempted to conceal \"nonessential Internet use,\" and nearly 4% reported feeling \"preoccupied by the Internet when offline.\" About 8% said they used the Internet as a way to escape problems, and almost 14% reported they \"found it hard to stay away from the Internet for several days at a time.\" \"The Internet problem is still in its infancy,\" said Elias Aboujaoude, a Stanford professor. No single online activity is to blame for excessive use, he said. \"They\\'re online in chat rooms, checking e-mail, or writing blogs. not limited to porn or gambling\" websites. Excessive Internet use should be defined not by the number of hours spent online but \"in terms of losses,\" said Maressa Orzack, a Harvard University professor. \"If it\\'s a loss you\\'re not getting to work, and family relationships are breaking down as a result, then it\\'s too much.\" Since the early 1990s, several clinics have been established in the U. S. to treat heavy Internet users. They include the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery and the Center for Internet Behavior. The website for Orzack\\'s center lists the following among the psychological symptoms of computer addiction: * Having a sense of well-being or excitement while at the computer. * Longing for more and more time at the computer. * Neglect of family and friends. * Feeling empty, depressed or irritable when not at the computer. * Lying to employers and family about activities. * Inability to stop the activity. * Problems with school or job. Physical symptoms listed include dry eyes, backaches, skipping meals, poor personal hygiene and sleep disturbances. People who struggle with excessive Internet use maybe depressed or have other mood disorders, Orzack said. When she discusses Internet habits with her patients, they often report that being online offers a \"sense of belonging, and escape, excitement fun,\" she said. \"Some people say relief...because they find themselves so relaxed.\" Some parts of the Internet seem to draw people in more than others. Internet gamers spend countless hours competing in games against people from all over the world. One such game, called World of Warcraft, is cited on many sites by posters complaining of a \"gaming addiction.\" Andrew Heidrich, an education network administrator from Sacramento, plays World of Warcraft for about two to four hours every other night, but that\\'s nothing compared with the 40 to 60 hours a week he spent playing online games when he was in college. He cut back only after a full-scale family intervention , in which s told him he\\'d gained weight. \"There\\'s this whole culture of competition that sucks people in\" with online gaming, said Heidrich, now a father of two. \"People do it at the expense of everything that was a constant in their lives.\" Heidrich now visits websites that discuss gaming addiction regularly \"to remind myself to keep my love for online games in check.\" Toebe also regularly visits a site where posters discuss Internet overuse. In August, when she first realized she had a problem, she posted a message on a Yahoo Internet addiction group with the subject line: \"I have an Internet Addiction.\" \"I\\'m self-employed and need the Internet for my work, but I\\'m failing to accomplish my work,to take care of my home, to give attention to my children,\" she wrote in a message sent to the group.\"I have no money or insurance to get professional help; I can\\'t even pay my mortgage and face losing everything.\" Since then, Toebe said, she has kept her promise to herself to cut back on her Internet use. \"I have a boyfriend now, and I\\'m not interested in online dating,\" she said by phone last week. \"It\\'s a lot better now.\"']\n",

A traitor had just come in and told them where Bruce had slept the night before.

He was resolved that if under the dog\\'s guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited. He sniffed here and there, eagerly hunted up and down the cottage, then made a circuit round it, and at last, with a loud deep bay he started off with his nose to the ground, pulling so hard at the chain that Archie had difficulty in keeping up with him. Pembroke and his knights rode a little behind, followed by their men-at-arms. \\n\\n\"I pray you, Sir Earl,\" Archie said, \"keep not too close to my traces, for the sound of the horse\\'s hoofs and the jingling of the equipments make him all the more impatient to get forward, and even now it taxes all my strength to hold him in.\" ']\n",

With a 2016 Census-estimated population of 476,015, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at . Staten Island is the only borough of New York with a non-Hispanic White majority. The borough is coextensive with Richmond County, and until 1975 was the Borough of Richmond. Its flag was later changed to reflect this. Staten Island has been sometimes called \"the forgotten borough\" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government. \\n\\nThe North Shore—especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton—is the most urban part of the island; it contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul\\'s Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character. The West Shore is the least populated and most industrial part of the island.']\n",

It was founded in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center. OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog (OPAC) in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries have to pay for its services (around $200\\xa0million annually ). \\n\\nOCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of Ohio university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for Ohio libraries. The group first met on July 5, 1967 on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization. The group hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, to design the shared cataloging system. Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management. The goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world\\'s information to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first occurrence of online cataloging by any library worldwide.']\n",

It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was originally Wilton, after which the county is named, but Wiltshire Council is now based in the county town of Trowbridge. \\n\\nWiltshire is characterised by its high downland and wide valleys. Salisbury Plain is noted for being the location of the Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks, and as a training area for the British Army.

The Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age people that occupied southern Britain built settlements on the hills and downland that cover Wiltshire. Stonehenge and Avebury are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK. \\n\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries Wiltshire was at the western edge of Saxon Britain, as Cranborne Chase and the Somerset Levels prevented the advance to the west. The Battle of Bedwyn was fought in 675 between Escuin, a West Saxon nobleman who had seized the throne of Queen Saxburga, and King Wulfhere of Mercia. In 878 the Danes invaded the county.
